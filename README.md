# Airbus OneAtlas Data Downloader
The Airbus OneAtlas Data Downloader is a custom Toolbox used in ArcGIS Pro. The toolbox automates download, and decompression of products ordered through OneAtlas Data. The decompression step is optional. Once downloaded, ArcGIS Pro provides extensive 2D and 3D raster visualization and analysis capabilities. ArcGIS Pro also provides a powerful publishing command (Create Hosted Imagery Layers), which publishes imagery to ArcGIS Image for ArcGIS Online. In addition to streaming full band count & bit depth raster data, Hosted Imagery Layers also present a rich set of raster capabilities in support of 2D and 3D visualization, custom band composites, band indices, stretch, classification, and extensive support for analysis. Details on the requirements, setup, and operation of these tools is covered in detail in the documentation https://github.com/dkwright/Airbus-OneAtlas-Data-Downloader/blob/master/documentation/Airbus_OneAtlas_Data_Downloader_User_Guide.pdf
